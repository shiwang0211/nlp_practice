# NLP Practice
The purpose of this repository is to practice NLP-related concepts and models 

## Sentiment_Analysis_v1.ipynb
- Replicat Sentiment Analysis (Negative/Positive Comments)
  - Pretrained word vectors
  - Methodology: 1) LSTM; 2) CNN 
  - Tool: Tensorflow lower-level API

## Sentiment_Analysis_v2.ipynb
- Replicat Sentiment Analysis (Negative/Positive Comments)
  - Trained word vectors using `train_word2vec`
  - Methodology: 1) LSTM; 2) CNN 
  - Tool: Keras with Tensorflow Backend

## Word Embedding.ipynb
- Build word representation using `Skip-Gram` model
- Use off-the-shelf `Word2Vec` package to train model

## nltk_learn.ipynb
Work through examples with NLTK package for textc preprocessing, stemming, tagging, etc.
