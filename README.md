Practice for NLP-related concepts and models 

## NLP_v1.ipynb
- Use LSTM and CNN to build Sentiment Analysis model (using Tensorflow)

## NLP_v2.ipynb
- Part I: Build word representation using Skip-Gram model
- Part II: Use off-the-shelf Word2Vec package to train
- Part III: Use LSTM and CNN to build Sentiment Analysis model (using Keras)

## nltk_learn.ipynb
Work through examples with NLTK package for textc preprocessing, stemming, tagging, etc.
