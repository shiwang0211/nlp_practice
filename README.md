# NLP Practice
The purpose of this repository is to practice NLP-related concepts and models 

## 1. Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb
- Memory-based CF
    - User-Item Filtering
    - Item-Item Filtering
- Model-based CF
    - Matrix Factorization
    - Deep Learning
- Implementation of deep-learning-based CF with keras

## 2. seq2seq.ipynb
- Encoder/Decoder Machine Translation architecture with a character-level translation model (implemented with Keras)
- Develop attention model with a synthetic example (add extra attention mechanism based on Keras layers)


## 3. Word Embedding.ipynb
- Build word representation using `Skip-Gram` model (with Tensorflow low-level API)
    - Prepare data batch
    - Define network graph
- Use off-the-shelf `Word2Vec` package to train model


## 4. nltk_learn.ipynb
Work through examples with `NLTK` package for text:
- Preprocessing (tokenize, stop words, stemming, etc)
- Feature extraction (DTM, TF-IDF)

## 5. Sentiment_Analysis_v1.ipynb
- Replicate Sentiment Analysis (Negative/Positive Comments)
  - Use pretrained word vectors
  - Methodology: 1) LSTM; 2) CNN 
  - Tool: Tensorflow lower-level API

## 6. Sentiment_Analysis_v2.ipynb
- Replicate Sentiment Analysis (Negative/Positive Comments)
  - Train word vectors using `word2vec` package
  - Methodology: 1) LSTM; 2) CNN 
  - Tool: Keras with Tensorflow Backend
